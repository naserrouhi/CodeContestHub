## Fun with Classes #2 - Animals and Inheritance

### Overview
Preloaded for you in this Kata is a `class Animal`:

```csharp
public class Animal
{
  public int Age;
  public int Legs;
  public string Name;
  public string Species;
  public string Status;
  
  public Animal(string name, int age, int legs, string species, string status)
  {
    this.Name = name;
    this.Age = age;
    this.Legs = legs;
    this.Species = species;
    this.Status = status;
  }
  
  public virtual string Introduce()
  {
    return $"Hello, my name is {this.Name} and I am {this.Age} years old.";
  }
}
```

### Task
Define the following classes that inherit from `Animal`.

### I. Shark
The constructor function for Shark should accept 3 arguments in total in the following order: `name, age, status`. **All sharks should have a leg count of `0` (since they obviously do not have any legs) and should have a `species` of `"shark"`.**

### II. Cat
The constructor function for Cat should accept the same 3 arguments as with Shark: `name, age, status`. Cats should always have a leg count of `4` and a species of `"cat"`.

Furthermore, the `introduce`/`Introduce` method for `Cat` should be identical to the original except there should be **exactly 2 spaces** and the words `"Meow meow!"` after the phrase. For example:

```csharp
Cat example = new Cat("Example", 10, "Happy);
example.Introduce() => "Hello, my name is Example and I am 10 years old.  Meow meow!"; // Notice the TWO spaces - very important
```

### III. Dog
The Dog constructor should accept 4 arguments in the specified order: `name, age, status, master`. `master` is the name of the dog's master which will be a string. Furthermore, dogs should have `4` legs and a species of `"dog"`.

Dogs have an identical `introduce`/`Introduce` method as any other animal, but they have their own method called `greetMaster`/`GreetMaster` which accepts no arguments and returns `"Hello (insert_master_name_here)"` (of course not the literal string but replace the `(insert_master_name_here)` with the name of the dog's master).
